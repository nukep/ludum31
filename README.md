# Mr. Scroll

*Theme: Entire Game on One Screen*

Mr. Scroll is a scrolling platformer that wraps across the screen.
You use the scrolling mechanic to progress towards the exit.

This is my entry for the Ludum Dare 31 Jam, written entirely in Rust.
In addition, I used the Tiled map editor and PyxelEdit for tilesets.

All audio is synthesized in-game, and resembles NES-style audio
(there are 4 channels after all: 2 pulses, 1 triangle, and 1 noise).
